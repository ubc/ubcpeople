WordPress plugin to create fancy public profile pages which can pull in feeds from external sites like Facebook, Twitter, WordPress, etc

Still very much under development.

Person profiles are currently accessed at www.example.com/?person=username

Nothing shows up if the user hasn't enabled their public profile (controlled from the default wordpress edit profile screen)

From the Dashboard, the settings page is accessed at Settings->People.
