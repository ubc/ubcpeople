Defining additional services:
---------------------------

The existing ones are found in ubcpeople/include/services/

To add another you can create a new file in that directory and include it in the main file ubcpeople.php

Required functions
	
	ubcpeople_{service_name}_get_icon(); 
		Get the information for the icon displayed on the profile page
		
	ubcpeople_{service_name}(); 
		Retrieve and echo the contents to be displayed in the overlay window for a particular service
		
	ubcpeople_{service_name}_add();
		Output the form to add a particular service
		See facebook.php for an example of one that required authentication
		See ubc_blogs.php or others for examples not requiring authentication. 
			Each of those forms consists of a username field and two hidden fields to indicate which external service and one to indicate which user we're adding it to
		
There's a hook 'ubcpeople_admin' to run code needed for the admin interface, most importantly the form to add a particular service.	You can see how the other services use it 

Lastly add it to ubcpeople_get_available_services() in the main file
